* we will build a website together
	** LOL jk, you guys gotta do it 
	** NOTE: this is hard - but that's part of the fun
	** begin by first divying up all the necessary components of the site into functional blocks...then code the blocks 
	** work in pairs! 
* pseudo code : FIRST DRAW IT OUT (but with thermostat example)
	* pseudo conditionals
	* pseudo loops
	* pseudo variabls
	* http://xkcd.com/149/
* thermostat
	get target_temprature
	target_temperature = 72
	repeat forever,
	      current_temperature = get_sensor_reading
	      if target_temperature > (current_temperature+5),
	          turn_on_heater
	      if target_temperature <= current_temperature,
	          turn_off_heater
* ( PSEUDO ) CODE ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS GUYS! (best 3 out of 5)
* what can JS do? show examples of sites 
* traffic light: http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/shtLA
	** The yellow button changes the bulb to purple and the green light does not work. Students are to change the code so that the traffic light works correctly.
